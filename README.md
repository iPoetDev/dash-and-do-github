## 1.1. [Goals](#goals)

-   #Client/Assessor #RFP To build a full-stack site based on business logic used to control a centrally owned dataset.
-   #Client/Assessor #RFP To set up an authentication mechanism and provide role-based access to the site's data or other
    activities based on the dataset.
-   #Solution To integrate GitHub with the Web App via GitHub social login and authentication tokens, with full lifecycle
    account management, via onboarding and offboarding of this social login.
-   #Solution To authorized and grant permissions to the web app, as a 3rd party` service|integration`, to one's own
    GitHub account or, maybe, a secondary one.
-   #Solution To use GitHub API to perform the following
    -   Analyse and graphically report on Languages used
    -   Analyse and graphically report on File Types used
    -   Analyse and collated the labels used across all accounts
    -   CRUD and manipulate Issue Labels in bulk, centrally and apply to `all|selected` repositories in bulk.
    -   Copy and Apply a central store of common file types to to `all|selected` repositories in bulk.
-   #Project To use agile methodologies and tooling to deliver the #Solution to the #Client/Assessor: **<ins>The Code
    Institute</ins>

## 2. [Problem Statement](#problem-solve)

### 2.1. [Domain Driven Scenarios](#domain-scenarios)

A. **GitHub As a Portfolio?**

> > A question that occurs: _how can a developer treat and tailor his whole GitHub as a single sharable artefact in their portfolio and as a basis for his portfolio; and share to outside, or not GitHub account holders, and maximise the value of their GitHub account without given 3rd party access or having another crawl across their repositories in multiple pages and clicks._

B.

> > A question that occurs: _how can a potential employer inspect a prospective developer's GitHub at a glance, with meaningful analytics and high-level summary data?_

C.

> > A question that occurs: _how can, based on the prior question, can a developer keep track of the standard, conventional and best practices, on a per repository or bulk repository basis, with cross cutting concerns? Can he keep a in context to-do repository management list of common or standard tasks to maintain and manage his account over numerous repositories (i.e. greater than 5)._

D.

> > A question that occurs: _how can a developer apply GitHub features, which are manually created (e.g. labels, custom project fields), uniformly across more than two repositories and save time and effort on duplicative, repetitive and non-DRY iterative efforts. Such efforts have the challenge of lack of consistency and not being standard/best practice
> > driven._

E.

> > A question that occurs: _how can a developer apply GitHub best practices, like conventions and common files (examples of which are documented here), uniformly across more than two repositories and save time and effort on duplicative, repetitive and iterative file generation efforts. These generation efforts done once and repeated many times from a central source._

### 2.2. [Problem Concern](#problem-concern)

-   A GitHub account is a partially DRY system, and this is a dis-benefit to the author-developer.
-   A GitHub repository is a partially DRY system, and this is a dis-benefit to the author-developer.
-   A GitHub account is intentionally a fully adaptable and flexible platform; it is aimed to meet the widest number of use cases, target audiences via its universally open design.
    -   This lead to several user driven tasks to be manual, repetitive and not very good for DRY iteration.
    -   Such as:
        1.   Label creation
        2.   Issue Templates, in part
        3.   GitHub Common Files (see below)
-   A GitHub account has no central store for certain artefacts that allow for one time editing and the more than one repository deployment, over a group of repositories. Such effort to duplicate and apply these programmatically.
-   A GitHub account does have selected analytics on a account or profile level basis. However, any proposed solution is looking to extend these analytics to drive an better "at a glance" overview.
-   There are no, as yet known by the author-developer, bulk editing features across two or more repositories. Such a feature would allow for improved user management experience in the application of conventions, standards and best practices.

### 2.3. [Developer Motivations](#motivations)

-   The author-developer needs a problem in search of a solution for an academic assignment, and as such is extending the
    GitHub concepts where they see dis-benefits or constraints in functionality.
-   The author-developer is sticking to what they know in a familiar domain, GitHub, and is seeking to deepen their
    knowledge and capacity in this platform. This they seek to showcase this in this project.
