### 1.1. [Goals](#goals)

#### 1.1.1 [App Goals](#app-goals)

-  To *manage a personal developerâ€™s GitHub account* as a whole portfolio service, by connecting, and disconnecting, the
  web service with a developer GitHub account (maximum of 1 GitHub account).
- Use a *Report and Inform Dashboard*  for the developer on the state of their repositories under a single glance on a
  single pane of glass pattern via a Dashboard design. i.e. **The Dash, aka Dash & Inform.**
- Use a *To-do and Action task manager* for the developer in response to the state of their repositories so that they
  bulk edit on a single pane of glass pattern via a To Do and Tasker design. I.e. **The Do, aka Do & Act.**

## 2.0 [Problem Statement](#problem-solve)

### 2.1. [Domain Driven Scenarios](#domain-scenarios)

A. **GitHub As a Portfolio?**

> > A question that occurs: _how can a developer treat and tailor his whole GitHub as a single sharable artefact in their portfolio and as a basis for his portfolio; and share to outside, or not GitHub account holders, and maximise the value of their GitHub account without given 3rd party access or having another crawl across their repositories in multiple pages and clicks._

B.

> > A question that occurs: _how can a potential employer inspect a prospective developer's GitHub at a glance, with meaningful analytics and high-level summary data?_

C.

> > A question that occurs: _how can, based on the prior question, can a developer keep track of the standard, conventional and best practices, on a per repository or bulk repository basis, with cross cutting concerns? Can he keep a in context to-do repository management list of common or standard tasks to maintain and manage his account over numerous repositories (i.e. greater than 5)._

D.

> > A question that occurs: _how can a developer apply GitHub features, which are manually created (e.g. labels, custom project fields), uniformly across more than two repositories and save time and effort on duplicative, repetitive and non-DRY iterative efforts. Such efforts have the challenge of lack of consistency and not being standard/best practice
> > driven._

E.

> > A question that occurs: _how can a developer apply GitHub best practices, like conventions and common files (examples of which are documented here), uniformly across more than two repositories and save time and effort on duplicative, repetitive and iterative file generation efforts. These generation efforts done once and repeated many times from a central source._

### 2.2. [Problem Concern](#problem-concern)

-   A GitHub account is a partially DRY system, and this is a dis-benefit to the author-developer.
-   A GitHub repository is a partially DRY system, and this is a dis-benefit to the author-developer.
-   A GitHub account is intentionally a fully adaptable and flexible platform; it is aimed to meet the widest number of use cases, target audiences via its universally open design.
    -   This lead to several user driven tasks to be manual, repetitive and not very good for DRY iteration.
    -   Such as:
        1. Label creation
        2. Issue Templates, in part
        3. GitHub Common Files (see below)
-   A GitHub account has no central store for certain artefacts that allow for one time editing and the more than one repository deployment, over a group of repositories. Such effort to duplicate and apply these programmatically.
-   A GitHub account does have selected analytics on a account or profile level basis. However, any proposed solution is looking to extend these analytics to drive an better "at a glance" overview.
-   There are no, as yet known by the author-developer, bulk editing features across two or more repositories. Such a feature would allow for improved user management experience in the application of conventions, standards and best practices.

### 2.3. [Developer Motivations](#motivations)

-   The author-developer needs a problem in search of a solution for an academic assignment, and as such is extending the
    GitHub concepts where they see dis-benefits or constraints in functionality.
-   The author-developer is sticking to what they know in a familiar domain, GitHub, and is seeking to deepen their
    knowledge and capacity in this platform. This they seek to showcase this in this project.

## 3.0 [Project](#project)

### 3.1. [Project Brief](#brief)

_To build a Full-Stack site based on business logic used to control a centrally owned dataset._

_Additionally, need to set up an authentication mechanism and provide role-based access to the site's data or other
activities based on the dataset._

---

### 3.2. [Project Methodology](#methodology)

-   [x] **ADR**: [ADR000X - Choose a project management and delivery methodology]()

- **Chosen**: Agile Methodology
- **Why**: Proscribed by the Client: The Code Institute as part of their software project portfolio development series
  in portfolio project 4: Full Stack Toolkit
- _Approach_:
    - Breaks project into iterative phases (i.e. sprints).
    - Emphasizes continuous adaption, adjustment to change, improvement, releases and customer feedback.
    - It's a cycle of flexible planning, execution and evaluation.
    - Is customised for a solo developer.
- _Is not_:
    - A collaborative approach for this solo project.

#### 3.2.1 Project Tooling: Zube.io

- The author/developer choose against using GitHub Projects for Agile Management, as it required a long of imposition of
  agile principles to be configured correctly.
- The author/developer choose for using a 3rd party Project Management Tool: [zube.io](https://zube.io/).
    - Has [Agile Components](https://zube.io/docs/components).
    - [GitHub Issues Can be Agile if You Do it Right | The Zube Blog](https://zube.io/blog/agile-project-management-workflow-for-github-issues/)
    - Installable via [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace/zube)
    - Is a stand-alone Agile Project Management tool.
    - Integrates and synchronises with GitHub Issues.
    - Organises and uses a Kanban Board and/or Sprint Boards
    - Defines Agile Epics and Scrum Style sprints
    - Is Free (up to 4 Users)
    - Utilises GitHub account or Gmail for social access login.
- The disadvantage (for assessment) is that:
    - Requires either a known Gmail account or a known GitHub to sign up.
    - By constraint, there is no common inbox for assessors to issue an onboarding email.
    - Assessors must be anonymous.
    - Requires a standalone temporary email account with a supplied username and password i.e. a proxy account.
    - This proxy guarantees the anonymity of the assessment process for the assessor.
    - Requires testing and testing before deadline.

Other benefits, that capitalises on prior effort by the author, was

- Provides a separate UI for managing the GitHub repository, issues, issues, milestones, templates that synchronises
  with GitHub.
- Can bulk edit issues and other features, with improved global effort and control.
- Integration of GitHub Issue Templates (see [3.3 Agile Artefacts](README.md#artefacts) below.)
- Definition of a End to End Workflow
    - ![](docs/assets/img-readme/3-2-1_zube-kanban-workflow.png)
- Has an inbuilt priorities over the setup of the GitHub Projects from blank slate
    - Blocker (P1), Critical (P2), Major (P3), Minor (P4), Trivial (P5)
- Uses a points system (Criteria: Merit: 1.5: User Stories, Points & Timeboxes prioritisations)
    - Uses a Fibonacci System (0,1,2,4,5,8,13). For purposes of this project, 13 is the max.
    - Employs a relative
      sizing, [see here: Practical Fibonacci: A Beginner's Guide to Relative Sizing | Scrum.org](https://www.scrum.org/resources/blog/practical-fibonacci-beginners-guide-relative-sizing)

#### 3.2.2 Relative Points

These relative points are a story point matrix of *Certainty/Risk* (y-axis) against *Effort/Complexity* (x axis), and
uses *Amount of Work* labels to categorise the scoring

- [ ] Resize 50%
- `Source`: [How to Begin Story PointÂ Estimating](https://joshmartindev.com/2022/04/29/how-to-begin-story-point-estimating/)

- **Zero Points**: No Effort Required, or there is some effort required, but there is no business value delivered, so no
  Points are accumulated for doing the work.
    - <ins>0 pts: NO EFFORT: Very Easy (0) || No Uncertainty (0)</ins>
- **1-2 Points**: Developer feel they understand most requirements
  Developers consider it relatively easy, probably smallest items in the Sprint, and mostly likely completed in one day.
    - <ins>1 pts: EXTRA SMALL: Very Easy (1) || No Uncertainty (1)</ins>
    - <ins>2 pts: SMALL: Very Easy (1) || Little Uncertainty (2)</ins>
    - <ins>2 pts: SMALL: Medium (2) || No Uncertainty (1)</ins>
- **3 Points**: Developer(s) have done this a lot; knows what needs to be done.
  There may be a few extra steps. It's doubtful that extra research will be need.
    - <ins>3 pts: AVERAGE: Medium (3) || No Uncertainty (1)</ins>
    - <ins>3 pts: AVERAGE: Very Easy (1) || Little Uncertainty (3)</ins>
- **5 Points**: This is complex work, or Developers don't do this very often.
  Most Developers will need assistance from someone else. This is probably one of the largest items that can be
  completed within a Sprint.
    - <ins>5 pts: LARGE: Medium (5) || No Uncertainty (1)</ins>
    - <ins>5 pts: LARGE: Easy, Low Complexity (1) || Some Uncertainty (5)</ins>
- **8 Points**: Is going to take some time and research. Will take more than 1 developer to complete within two weeks.
  Plus: Developer need to make several assumptions that increase the risk. Likely to impact getting it Done.
    - <ins>8 pts: EXTRA LARGE: Hard Complexity (8) || No Uncertainty (1)</ins>
    - <ins>8 pts: LARGE: Easy, Low Complexity (1) || High Uncertainty (8)</ins>
- **13 Points**: Is a complex piece of work with lots of unknowns.
    - Requires multiple assumptions to size. It is too much to complete in one Sprint. Instead, split this into multiple
      Items that can be completed independently.
    - <ins>13 pts: WARNING: Hard Complexity (13) || Low Uncertainty (1)</ins>
    - <ins>13 WARNING: Easy, Low Complexity (1) || High Uncertainty (13)</ins>

### 4.3. [Web App Capabilities](#app-capabilities)

-   [ ] Criteria:
-   [ ] Review
-   [ ] Completed?

This app will serve users with the following:

- Ability, **_must have_**, to _`use|integrate`_ GitHub as a _`primary|secondary`_ _`social login`_ to
  _`access|connect`_ and _`authenticate`_ to the main web _`app|service`_. #Authentication #Access #Authorisation
  #Onboarding
- Ability, **_must have_**, to _`interact`_ with GitHub's API to access the public application and data interfaces of
  the GitHub platform, so to _`manipulate`_ and _`aggregate`_ one's own _`account|repository`_ data. #API #RestFul
- Ability, **_should have_**, to _`analyse`_ all repositories, _`public and|or private`_ and _`categorise`_ them, in
  bulk: #Repositories #DataAnalysis
    - The scope and frequency of languages uses. GitHub has this feature per repository.
    - The scope and frequency of file types uses (?). Subject to GitHub API definitions and terms of service.
    - The presence/absence of labels, number and completeness.
- Ability, **_should have_**, to _`report`_, using a _`client|server`_ rendered visual summarisation and collation
  approach, on the state of all repositories, and to _`provide`_ a an **_`"at a glance"`_** snapshot on the state of the
  account's repositories.
- Ability, **_could have_**, to perform bulk actions on specific GitHub features like:
    - **_Labels_** #FeatureCRUD
    - **_`Config.yml`_** #FileIO #API-I/O
    - **_Common Files_**, or Common Project files (see below). #FileI/O #API-I/O
- Ability, **could have**, to `store` a central file _`type|store`_, i.e. a pre-defined template, for a specific purpose
  and then `'Copy'` and `'Apply'` across those repository that do not have them. #FileIO #API-I/O
    - **Will not** have the ability to edit or change these files inside the web app.
        - This is out of scope as IDEs and the basic GitHub editing functionalities serve this role.
            - **Will not** have the ability to manipulate GitHub Account Settings or have the permission granted to
              them.
              #NotInScope
- Ability, **should have**, to _`remove`_ a GitHub _`social login`_ as a _`primary|secondary`_ source of _`access`_,
  _`authorisation`_ and or _`authentication`_, without affecting the primary login model and access control. #GitHub

### 4.4. [Real User Frustration](#user-frustrations)

-   [ ] Criteria:
-   [ ] Completed? ðŸ›«

This comes from the author/developerâ€™s personal experience and fustrations. Given othersâ€™ comments in the Code
Institute, this may not be an isolated experience.

- Many of the GitHub platform activities are manual, iterative and repetitive.
    - This is am admirable quality of flexibility for maximum customisation and adaptability.
    - On the other hand, applying the same conventions, and standards consistently and uniformly across all the
      repositories is inconsistent, poor levelling of features, and user generated data etc.
- These user and usability frustration are a by-product of the user's personal experiences and user journey when using
  GitHub.com.

### 5.3. [Constraints](#contraints)

- An Agile Methodology is **mandated**, using Epic and User Stories as key artefacts.
- HTML, CSS and JavaScript are _recommended_ front-end technologies.
- Python and Django (web framework) are _recommended_ back-end technologies.
- Model View Controller is a _recommended_ architectural design pattern, a code factoring principle.
- That CRUD as a data manipulation pattern is **mandated**.
- A relational database is implicitly **mandated**, and is constrained by cost/affordability and access.
- A local version source control toolset, that uses Git, is **mandated**.
- A remote version source control platform, like GitHub.com, is **mandated**.
- A cloud based hosting platform is _recommended_, though the ultimate selection of which is up to developer.
- A Readme is a **mandated** and conventional documentation pattern that utilises the markdown format.
- The Readme **must be** written in English.
- The Readme can follow a _recommend_ structure.
- The web application **must have** a `lang` attribute set to English.

### 5.4 [Browsers Compatibility](#compatibilities)

- The application design for the web is further constrained by it's available global or local audience and their
  install-base of a browser.
- Browser compatibility is a essential aspect of a web application as the browser is the fundamental web application
  end-point
- Developer tools, like Autofixer (which tailwind recommends for applying browser vendor pre-fixes) aid in ensuring code
  compatibility and quality with Browsers
- So using these two services will aid the developer experience and ultimately the user experience

1. CanIUse
2. BrowserlIsr

#### 5.4.2 BrowserList

> SOLUTION: Developer Tool | Developer Experience | Audience Research | Browser Compatibility | Web App Performance

- Go
  to [Browserl.ist](https://browsersl.ist/#q=%3E0.3%25%2C+defaults%2C+supports+es6-module%2C+maintained+node+versions)
- View the query of the following in the above lint.
-
    - Added to` package.json` in root of project
- Audience coverage:97.3 %

-   [ ] Criteria:
-   [ ] Completed? ðŸ›«

> > - A README has visualisation/presentation constraints for presenting matrix like interconnected data, as below, due
      to its linear nature.
>> - Note that the author has created and split readme into 17 sections, given the projected length/complexity of the
     final
     readme.
> > - Refer to the following preconfigured GitHub tooling/features for a more interactive Agile tool.
> > - These planning artefacts are outline lists or checklists, not active deliverables.

### 6.1. [Planning Tool](#agile-tool)

> PROJECT: Tooling


**Choices**:

- _Chosen_: Zube.io AND **<ins>GitHub (Free)</ins>
  **: `GitHub Projects`, `GitHub Issues`, `GitHub Milestones`, `GitHub Labels`.
    - because it is free, integrated, localised, and GitHub is a recommended platform for VCS, though more
      effort/labour/investment to setup, configure from a blank start.

title: "The C4 model for visualising software architecture"
image: "https://static.structurizr.com/workspace/36141/diagrams/SystemContext.png"
description:
"1. A set of hierarchical abstractions (software systems, containers, components, and code).
2. A set of hierarchical diagrams (system context, containers, components, and code).
3. Notation independent.
4. Tooling independent."
url: "https://c4model.com/"
```

- **Benefits**:
    - Is a map to the code
    - Notion & Tooling independent

> SOLUTION: Application | Data Store | Sub System | Contained Design

-   [x] Completed
-   [ ] Reviewed?

- [Level 2: Container Diagram](https://c4model.com/#ContainerDiagram) - on C4Model.com
- `A container is essentially a context or boundary inside which some code is executed or some data is stored.`
- Each container 's:
    - a separately deployable/runnable thing or runtime environment.
    - typically (but not always) running in its own process space.
    - communication between containers typically takes the form of an inter-process communication (e.g. API, RPC etc).

##### 7.3.0.1 Definitions

- **Server-side web application**:
    - e.g. A Java EE web application running on Apache Tomcat, an ASP.NET MVC application running on Microsoft IIS, a
      Ruby on Rails application running on WEBrick, a Node.js application, etc.
- **Client-side web application**:
    - e.g. A JavaScript application running in a web browser using Angular, Backbone.JS, jQuery, etc.
- **Serverless function**:
    - A single serverless function (e.g. Amazon Lambda, Azure Function, etc).
- **Database**:
    - e.g. A schema or database in a relational database management system, document store, graph database, etc such as
      MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Database, MongoDB, Riak, Cassandra, Neo4j, etc.

### 8.1 Structure

> Information Architecture | Site Map

#### 8.1.1 Navigation & IA

> Site Page | Page Locations | Page Relationships | Page Access

There are two major journeys at this level of hierarchy:

- **Public Access for Guest Visitors and Unauthenticated Users** who may or may not be prospective new users (Left hand
  side of site map)
- **Private Access for Authorised Visitors and Authenticated Users** who are current users (right hand side of site map)

There are three tiers of pages or associated workflows

- **Primary Pages**
  Pages a user can navigate to my primary or secondary navigation `<a>` links
  There are 3 level of views/page access:
    - **Mixed**: Index (*App*) i.e.  (Mixed: Public and Private), or otherwise: **ALL** or **ALLViews**
    - **Public**: About (*Static*), FAQ (*Static*), Reset (*App*) via PublicViews
    - **Private**: Dash (*App*), Do (*App*), Account (*App*) via PrivateViews
- **Service Pages**
  Often are orphan pages, that are dead ends or are a one time or infrequently accessed due to certain conditions, like#
    - Error Pages (HTTP Errors: 404, 403, 500+)
    - Verification Pages: Verify (Status pages for Public flows)
    - Confirmation Pages: Confirm (Status pages for Private flows)
- **Workflows & Forms**
  These processes are a combination of user interaction, user data submission, and data backend or email processes. They
  typically use email templates and end up on a verification service page.
    - *Sign Up Form:* Accessible by public users only. Send an verification email to new site user.
    - *Log In Form*: User enters the Private Access and gains access to the private pages, alongside the public
      navigation & public pages.
    - *Log out Control:* User exits the Private Access and looses access to the private pages, and only retains the
      public navigation & public pages.
    - *Reset Password Form*: Infrequent workflow when users properly manage their access. However is available on
      signup & login forms as secondary navigation link. Send an email reset password link.
    - *Contact Form*: Accessible by all users, defaults to public. Send an email to site contact and copy to the sender.

#### 8.4 Single Page & AJAX Flow using HTMX

##### 8.4.1 HTMX

According to [`html.org`](https://htmx.org/):

> htmx gives you access
> to[AJAX](https://htmx.org/docs/#ajax),[CSS Transitions](https://htmx.org/docs/#css_transitions),[WebSockets](https://htmx.org/docs/#websockets)
> and[Server Sent Events](https://htmx.org/docs/#sse)directly in HTML,
> using[attributes](https://htmx.org/reference/#attributes), so you can
> build[modern user interfaces](https://htmx.org/examples/)with the[simplicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS)
> and[power](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm)of hypertext

The site
has [several essays that expand and expound on the concepts and benefits of hypermedia driven applications](https://htmx.org/essays/),
and it was the decision of the author/developer to pursue this as a interaction design paradigm. From the
essay: [</> htmx ~ Hypermedia-Driven Applications](https://htmx.org/essays/hypermedia-driven-applications/)

- The**Hypermedia Driven Application (HDA)**architecture is a new/old approach to building web applications.
- HDA architectures extending the existing HTML infrastructure of the web, namely HTML, by adding custom attributes (
  using a lightweight Javascript library.)
- HTMX and Django are a match well made and met.
- *Benefits*:
    - It combines the simplicity & flexibility of traditional Multi-Page Applications (MPAs) with the better user
      experience of[Single-Page Applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application)(SPAs).
    - Uses_declarative, HTML-embedded syntax_rather than imperative scripting to achieve better front-end interactivity
    - Interacts with the server**in terms of hypermedia**(i.e. HTML), particularly in the context of Django and Django
      driven HTML templates.
    - Uses JavaScript to not use JavaScript and or JSON for client side processing, network requests and http response
      payloads.

##### 8.4.2 Downgrading JavaScript to Client Side Interaction

Another significate consequence what the establishing of a design and development principle for the project to

- Minimise all possible client-side JavaScript processing where possible
- To allow only certain kinds and types of JavaScript by exception.
- To use recommended and compatible lightweight JavaScript for this purpose, such as [AplineJS](https://alpinejs.dev/),
  as recommended by [</> htmx ~ ](https://htmx.org), so to stay aligned with the **htmxâ€™s** HDA architecture, design and
  interaction paradigm.

##### 8.4.3 Hypermedia Drive Applications via  Single Page Architectures & HTML/HTMX

The following are AJAX driven single page architectures, using HTMX.

- **Index.html** for:
    - Sign Up Form
    - Login Form
    - Contact Form
- **Account.html** for:
    - User Profile Form
    - Link GitHub Form
    - User Settings form
- **Dash.html** for:
    - .
- **Do.html** for:
    - .

This means that:

- Where ever form or form like behaviours happen that initiated a HTTP Request and Response, the following happens and
  is a departure from the default html page behaviours:
    - The page does not completely reload on html5 form target value for a GET or POST action or a user interaction of
      another kind.
    - The HTMX library, via AJAX and Fetch, only reloads the designated HTML element, either by `id` attribute or by
      walking the DOM and using another target method like `OuterHTML`.
    - The page only reloads if the HTMX attribute enforces that or by user initated action like a page reload.
    - That status messages are displayed on the same page, either by a notification or by a status message in targeted /
      replaced block.
        - Status messages as confirmation, information, unsuccessful or error messages.

### 8.3 Skeleton

2. **Public Page User Flow and Wireframeâ€™s Page Sections**

![](docs/assets/img-readme/8-3-1-1_PublicPage-Wireframe-UserFlow.png)

#### 8.3.2 Mobile User Interactions

- For the purposes of this app, a mobile user is defined by the
    1. Breakpoints of the Tailwinds/CSS Media Query
        - UI elements are hidden and inert on small screens below 768px (below and not including Medium breakpoint  )
        - The benefit is that this is easily defined in development and tested, by â€˜â€˜foolingâ€™â€™ user.
        - The con is that this approach is not optimal for production level releases
            - Workarounds for this approach are
                - Mobile browsers have a view desktop version, which I think disables all media queries; and gives user
                  access via the desktop defaults.

- Mobile Users can
    - Browse the site using public navigation only.
        - Browse the Home page
        - Browse the FAQ page
        - Browse the About page
    - Contact the site via contact form and a message will be send to site owner and a copy to the sender
    - Sign Up to the Web App
    - Verify from a mobile
    - Can access public UI component

- Mobile Users can not
    - Can not browse the private navigation
    - See or navigate to the Login Form
    - Log in to the app
    - Can not access private UI components.

##### 8.3.2.1 Mobile User Public Page Flow

![](docs/assets/img-readme/8-3-2-1_MobileUser_Public-Page-Flow.png)

#### 8.3.3 Tablet & Desktop User Interactions (Tablet+ Users)

- For the purposes of this app, a tablet and or desktop user is defined by the
    1. Breakpoints of the Tailwinds/CSS Media Query
        - UI elements are show and available on medium and above sized screens; i.e. above 768px (above and including
          Tailwindâ€™s Medium breakpoint)
        - The benefit is that this is easily defined in development and tested, by â€˜â€˜foolingâ€™â€™ user.
        - The con is that this approach is not optimal for production level releases
            - Workarounds for this approach are
                - Mobile browsers have a view desktop version, which I think disables all media queries; and gives user
                  access via the desktop defaults.

- Tablet+ Users can for public access
    - Browse the site using public navigation only.
        - Browse the Home page
        - Browse the FAQ page
        - Browse the About page
    - Contact the site via contact form and a message will be send to site owner and a copy to the sender
    - Sign Up to the Web App
    - Verify from a mobile
    - Can access public UI component

- Tablet+ Users can also for private access
    - Can browse the private navigation
    - Can access the Login Form
    - Can log in to the app
    - Can access private UI components.

### 14.3. [BDD & User Acceptance](#user-acceptance)

> SOLUTION: User Acceptance | User Story Testing

-   [ ] Criteria
-   [ ] Completed? ðŸ›«

#### 14.3.1 BBD

- As per [BDD 101: Behavior-Driven Agile | Automation Panda.com](https://automationpanda.com/2017/02/01/bdd-101-bdd-and-agile/),

##### 14.3.1.1 Top Level Concepts
- BBD - Behaviour Driven Testing: optimally used for **black box testing**, higher order testing for the user experience. Learn more from: [BDD | Automation Panda](https://automationpanda.com/bdd/)
- Gherkin - domain specific language for behaviour scenarios. Learn more from: [BDD 101: The Gherkin Language | Automation Panda](https://automationpanda.com/2017/01/26/bdd-101-the-gherkin-language/)
- Feature: A user product or feature under test. [In BDD, What Should Be A Feature? | Automation Panda](https://automationpanda.com/2017/10/19/in-bdd-what-should-be-a-feature/)
- Scenario: Generally known as a test case, that concisely frames the behaviour under test.
- Give | When | Then: The structure specification keywords that uses natural language. not jargon, for all users to understand.
- Declarative: A focus on what behaviour is to happen, not how, and the expected outcome.
- Imperative: A focus on how behaviour operates, better suited to TDD and Unit testing.

##### 14.3.1.2  Further Reading:

- [BDD | Automation Panda](https://automationpanda.com/bdd/)

##### 14.3.1.3 AI Assisted Feature-Scenario Writing

- The author crafted and shaped the JetBrains AI Assistant (beta) to _conversationally_ (i.e. back and forth prompt-output-refactor) define the following Feature-Scenario as User Acceptance.
- This was a productivity, time manage and neural diversity win for the author.
- The author edited, groomed, aligned with his manually edited Epics, Features, and User Stories.
- These are then sorted, as per[ Python Behave](https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gherkin/#feature-testing-layout) and [Behave Django](https://behave-django.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage.html), in side and along side the package/apps under test, in `.feature` files

##### 14.3.1.4 Manual over Automation

- The intent and use of this approach, for the stage and development maturity of the author, is on
    - Manual testing over automation
    - Discovery of the features and behaviours (successful and side effects) scenarios
    - The formation of the testing steps by breakdown and refinement of the  Scenario along the lines of user behaviour and expectations linked to each User Story

- Why not automate (yet):
    - Learning curve requirements, starting from a novice stand point.
    - Extra effort v time management prioritisation.
    - Additional complexity v risk prioritisation.
    - Additional requirements and supplementary tooling for test environment configuration, management and tear down.

All of these tests with have the `@manual` tag on each scenario, and maybe a few with `@automatable` just to indicate which could be automated in the future.

> PROJECT: Git Commit History | Commit Message Style & Format

-   [x] Completed
-   [x] Criteria: LO-5.1-PASS

- **Approach**:
    - _Commit / Push Style_: Merge Only, no Squash, no Rebase. Meets criteria for a
        - `5.1: Use Git & GitHub for version control of a Full-Stack web application up to deployment, using commit messages to document the development process`
    - _Linting_: No Linting as decided to rigid a constraint
    - Instead: using a Side Notes plugin for IntelliJ IDE with pre-configured templates (see below)
- _Aim_: For consistency, manual and by conventional.

##### 15.3.2.2. Keep A Changelog

> PROJECT: Log | Notable Changes | Human Readable | Semantic Versioning

- **Link**: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
- **Method**: Integrated Keep A Changelog format for add, update, remove _into commit messages_.
    - Directly in the commit messages.
    - Reduced efforts by not maintaining the `changelog.md`.
    - Mostly adhered to Semantic Versioning approach.
    - A minor adjustment was to put a double-digit index for each separate commit if several occurred on one day.
- **Types**:
    - `Add`for new features.
    - `Update`for changes in existing functionality.
    - `Deprecate`for soon-to-be removed features.
    - `Remove`for now removed features.
    - `Fix`for any bug fixes.
    - `Secure`in case of vulnerabilities.

##### 15.3.2.3. Commit Message Templates

- Influenced by [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
