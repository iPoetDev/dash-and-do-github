In the context of Tailwind Editor Setup and Plugin Use ..
Facing the case were editors this can trigger warnings or errors where Tailwind @apply, @tailwind, @screen rules arenâ€™t recognized.  ..
We decided for Tailwind Prettier pluigin  ..
And neglected, as alternatives [none]  ..
To achieve, in full or in part, i) automatically sorts your classes by tailwind opinionated order, ii) prettier is a universal code styler in most IDE iii) and that JetBrains IDEs recognise @apply and CSS completions. ..
Accepting that `Cost` | `Effort` | `Trade Off` as some editors may need to disable native CSS linting/validations if your editor is very strict .
