-   Description:
    -   Gitleaks is a SAST tool for**detecting**and**preventing**hardcoded secrets like passwords, api keys, and tokens in
        git repos.
    -   Gitleaks is an**easy-to-use, all-in-one solution**for detecting secrets, past or present, in your code

#### Config

```python
# Title for the gitleaks configuration file.
title = "Gitleaks title"

# Extend the base (this) configuration. When you extend a configuration
# the base rules take precedence over the extended rules. I.e., if there are
# duplicate rules in both the base configuration and the extended configuration
# the base rules will override the extended rules.
# Another thing to know with extending configurations is you can chain together
# multiple configuration files to a depth of 2. Allowlist arrays are appended
# and can contain duplicates.
# useDefault and path can NOT be used at the same time. Choose one.
[extend]
# useDefault will extend the base configuration with the default gitleaks config:
# https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks/blob/master/config/gitleaks.toml
useDefault = true
# or you can supply a path to a configuration. Path is relative to where gitleaks
# was invoked, not the location of the base config.
path = "common_config.toml"

# An array of tables that contain information that define instructions
# on how to detect secrets
[[rules]]

# Unique identifier for this rule
id = "awesome-rule-1"

# Short human readable description of the rule.
description = "awesome rule 1"

# Golang regular expression used to detect secrets. Note Golang's regex engine
# does not support lookaheads.
regex = '''one-go-style-regex-for-this-rule'''

# Golang regular expression used to match paths. This can be used as a standalone rule or it can be used
# in conjunction with a valid `regex` entry.
path = '''a-file-path-regex'''

# Array of strings used for metadata and reporting purposes.
tags = ["tag","another tag"]

# Int used to extract secret from regex match and used as the group that will have
# its entropy checked if `entropy` is set.
secretGroup = 3

# Float representing the minimum shannon entropy a regex group must have to be considered a secret.
entropy = 3.5

# Keywords are used for pre-regex check filtering. Rules that contain
# keywords will perform a quick string compare check to make sure the
# keyword(s) are in the content being scanned. Ideally these values should
# either be part of the idenitifer or unique strings specific to the rule's regex
# (introduced in v8.6.0)
keywords = [
  "auth",
  "password",
  "token",
]

# You can include an allowlist table for a single rule to reduce false positives or ignore commits
# with known/rotated secrets
[rules.allowlist]
description = "ignore commit A"
commits = [ "commit-A", "commit-B"]
paths = [
  '''go\.mod''',
  '''go\.sum'''

# note: (rule) regexTarget defaults to check the _Secret_ in the finding.
# if regexTarget is not specified then _Secret_ will be used.
# Acceptable values for regexTarget are "match" and "line"

# note: stopwords targets the extracted secret, not the entire regex match
# like 'regexes' does. (stopwords introduced in 8.8.0)

  '''endpoint''',
]

# This is a global allowlist which has a higher order of precedence than rule-specific allowlists.
# If a commit listed in the `commits` field below is encountered then that commit will be skipped and no
# secrets will be detected for said commit. The same logic applies for regexes and paths.

#### Baseline

```
gitleaks detect --report-path gitleaks-report.json
# This will save the report in a file called gitleaks-report.json
```

##### [Detect](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks#detect)

```
gitleaks detect --source . --log-opts="--all commitA..commitB"
```

```
git log -p
```

: [`git log -p`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#_generating_patch_text_with_p) [generates patches](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log#_generating_patch_text_with_p)
which gitleaks will use to detect secrets.

##### [Protect](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks#protect)

#### `.gitleaksignore`

Can ignore specific findings by creating a`.gitleaksignore`file at the root of your repo.

-   In release v8.10.0 Gitleaks added a`Fingerprint`value to the Gitleaks report.
-   Each leak, or finding, has a Fingerprint that uniquely identifies a secret.
-   Add this fingerprint to the`.gitleaksignore`file to ignore that specific secret.
-   See Gitleaks'[.gitleaksignore](https://github.com/zricethezav/gitleaks/blob/master/.gitleaksignore)for an example.
    Note: this feature is experimental and is subject to change in the future.

#### Exit

```bash
0 - no leaks present
1 - leaks or error encountered
126 - unknown flag
```
