### 10.1. [Branching](#branches)

> SOLUTION: Epic-Flow | Heroku-Flow | Trunk-Based Development

- [ ] Criteria:
- [ ] ADR: ADR000X Select a Branching Strategy
- [ ] Completed? ðŸ›«

- **Style**: Trunk Based Development (i.e. long lived branches for dedicated intents).
- **Epic-**: *Development Trunks*: Limited to number of epics, push from local to remote/origin.
- **Main**: *Integration Trunk*, CI Pull Request target from EPIC based branches into Main branch. No push from local to
  origin/main. Protected branch. Review Gate.
- **Heroku-**: *Deployment Trunks*, CI Pull Request target from Main into Heroku-* branches*.

-
    1. Pull Request from ``local/epic-*`` (the local) to ``origin/epic-*``(the remote) branch for **MANUAL COMMIT & PUSH

2. Protect ``origin/main`` & `origin/heroku` branch from changes or having anything pushed
3. Merge from ``epic-*`` to ``main`` branch for each code review, CI actions, and code quality checks (inc, pre-commits)
4. From `raw/new code` -> `linted code` -> `manually tested` -> `locally` ...?
5. Use **Trunk based development** from the **``local/epic-*``** branch to  **``origin/epic-*``** branch
    - Commit Style: Merge/Push to **``local/epic-*`` for development codebase.
    - Once the GitHub CI Apps (above) have passed all checks.
    - Tag|Label Code ready for **versioning/changelogging/pre-integration/commit**: Push to ``origin/epic-*`` on remote.

1. Pull Request from ``epic-*`` to ``main`` branch for **MANUAL INTEGRATION**
2. Protect ``main`` branch from changes or having anything pushed
3. Merge from ``epic-*`` to ``main`` branch for each code review, CI actions, and code quality checks (inc, AI Agent
   prompts)
4.

From `raw/new code` -> `linted code` -> `manually tested` -> `locally running` -> `PR#1` -> `Merge to Main` ->  `GitHub CI `

5. Use **Trunk based development** from the **``epic-*``** branch to **``main``** branch
    - Commit Style: Merge/Push to **``epic-*``** for development codebase.
    - Once the GitHub CI Apps (above) have passed all checks.

#### 10.1.3. Deploy-Flow

> SOLUTION: #Deployment | Diagram | Workflow

- [ ] Criteria
- [ ] Completed?

1. Pull Request from ``main`` to ``heroku`` branch for **AUTOMATED DEPLOYMENT**
2. Protect ``heroku`` branch from changes or having anything pushed
3. Merge from ``main`` to ``heroku`` branch for each release
4.

From `raw/new code` -> `linted code` -> `manually tested` -> `locally running` -> `PR#1` -> `Merge to Heroku` ->  `Heroku Automated`

5. Use **Trunk based development** from the ``main`` branch to ``heroku`` branch
    - Commit Style: Push to ``main`` for development codebase.
    - Once the GitHub CI Apps (above) have passed all checks.
    - Tag Code ready for deployment: Push to ``heroku``
    - Deployment is automated via Heroku's app deployment
    - By not having automated deployment on ```main```, there is no failed deployment noise on ``main`` branch and in
      the
      logs.
