### 12.1 3rd Party (GitHub) Tests & Proof of Concept Checks

- **Why**:
    - See [section X.Y]() for more information on the significant decisions for use.
- **Tooling**: [APIDog](https://apidog.com/)
    - An integrated platform for API design, debugging, development, mock, and testing.
    - Free & Opensource, with a [matrix comparison to Postman (the alternative)](https://apidog.com/blog/how-to-use-postman-for-api-testing/)
- **Usage**
    - Use to evaluate and explore the unfamiliar GitHub REST API ([Docs]([Quickstart for GitHub REST API - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/quickstart?apiVersion=2022-11-28)) | [API](https://api.github.com) )
    - Use to assert if the concept and design is viable for developers capacity and project timeframe.
    - Used to test and assert in the solution design, certain functionality: 
        - API heartbeat (service up/down), and Rate Limiting checks
        - Valid responses & payloads 
        - API/HTTP exception handling.
    - Use to debug custom API queries on a 3rd party API
