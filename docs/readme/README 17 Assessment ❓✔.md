-   [ ] Criteria:

#### 17.0.1 Assessor Access

- For many reasons, a custom domain and email hosting was established for this project. Here is one of the benefits: Assessor access and pre-configuration.

    - Domain: *dash-and-do.xyz*
        - Webmail:  _[https://mail1.netim.hosting/webmail/](https://mail1.netim.hosting/webmail/)_
        - Email, Username and password supplied.
    - Domain: *gmail.com*
        - Webmail: https://mail.google.com
        - Email and password supplied.
        - Forwards to: *dash-and-do.xyz* 

- Assessors are granted access of the following

| Resource    | Mail/Domian       | Preset | Supplied            | Notes                               | External Verification              | User Role |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ------ | ------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------- |
| Site Login  | *dash-and-do.xyz* | Yes    | Yes, Privately      |                                     | No                                 | User          |
| Admin Login | *dash-and-do.xyz* | Yes    | Yes, Privately      | Only after Site Login               | No                                 | Staff/Super          |
| Zube.io     | *gmail.com*       | Yes    | Yes, Pre-configured | Invite and access tested (23.01.01) | Maybe - A verification to Mobile?? | Member          |


- _`N.B`_: **Zube.io** requires Gmail (anonymous) and/or GitHub (more identifiable) as sole social logins and there is no domain linked email registration.
- Thus: a Gmail account (*`gmail.com`*) has been created for this purpose, and configured to forward on to the *`dash-and-do-xyz`*.

#### 17.0.2 Gmail Account Setup

The assessor may need to anonymously interact with the author on establishing Gmail on their account, during Gmail login, due to Google de-facto and default security mechanism. The author’s mobile was given on initial configuration. However this can be reassigned or an additional mobile could be assigned to facilitate this access and onboarding of the new device/location/access point by a secondary user.

- This account has value for subsequent projects assessments, under this and the custom email domain.
- The Gmail password recovery email is verified at the _`dash-and-do.xyz`_ domain and supplied email account, for which this is self resolving.

`No account details are supplied on a public resource for privacy and security purposes`. Contact the author via Student Care for additional requirements.
