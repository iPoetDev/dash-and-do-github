### 2.1. [Domain Driven Scenarios](#domain-scenarios)

> **SOLUTION**: Question Driven

- [x] Completed? ðŸ›« âœ… 2023-07-04

A.
> > A question that occurs: *how can a developer treat and tailor his whole GitHub as a single sharable artefact in
their portfolio and as a basis for his portfolio; and share to outside, or not GitHub account holders, and maximise the
value of their GitHub account without given 3rd party access or having another crawl across their repositories in
multiple pages and clicks.*

B.
> > A question that occurs: *how can a potential employer inspect a prospective developer's GitHub at a glance, with
meaningful analytics and high-level summary data?*

C.
> > A question that occurs: *how can, based on the prior question, can a developer keep track of the standard,
conventional and best practices, on a per repository or bulk repository basis, with cross cutting concerns? Can he keep
a in context to-do repository management list of common or standard tasks to maintain and manage his account over
numerous repositories (i.e. greater than 5).*

D.
> > A question that occurs: *how can a developer apply GitHub features, which are manually created (e.g. labels, custom
project fields), uniformly across more than two repositories and save time and effort on duplicative, repetitive and
non-DRY iterative efforts. Such efforts have the challenge of lack of consistency and not being standard/best practice
driven.*

E.
> > A question that occurs: *how can a developer apply GitHub best practices, like conventions and common files (
examples of which are documented here), uniformly across more than two repositories and save time and effort on
duplicative, repetitive and iterative file generation efforts. These generation efforts done once and repeated many
times from a central source.*

### 2.2. [Problem Concern](#problem-concern)

> **SOLUTION**: As-Is Problem Domain.

- [x] Criteria: LO-1.0-PASS | LO-1.3-MERIT | LO-3.1-MERIT
- [x] Completed? ðŸ›« âœ… 2023-07-04

- A GitHub account is a partially DRY system, and this is a dis-benefit to the author-developer.
- A GitHub repository is a partially DRY system, and this is a dis-benefit to the author-developer.
- A GitHub account is intentionally a fully adaptable and flexible platform; it is aimed to meet the widest number of
  use cases, target audiences via its universally open design.
    - This lead to several user driven tasks to be manual, repetitive and not very good for DRY iteration.
    - Such as:
        - Label creation
        - Issue Templates, in part
        - GitHub Common Files (see below)
- A GitHub account has no central store for certain artefacts that allow for one time editing and the more than one
  repository deployment, over a group of repositories. Such effort to duplicate and apply these programmatically.
- A GitHub account does have selected analytics on a account or profile level basis. However, any proposed solution is
  looking to extend these analytics to drive an better "at a glance" overview.
- There are no, as yet known by the author-developer, bulk editing features across two or more repositories. Such a
  feature would allow for improved user management experience in the application of conventions, standards and best
  practices.

### 2.3. [Developer Motivations](#motivations)

> **SOLUTION**: Developer's Why | Developer's Need | Academic Project || Academic Assignment |

- [x] Criteria: LO-1.0-PASS | LO-1.3-MERIT | LO-3.1-MERIT
- [x] Completed? ðŸ›« âœ… 2023-07-04

- The author-developer needs a problem in search of a solution for an academic assignment, and as such is extending the
  GitHub concepts where they see dis-benefits or constraints in functionality.
- The author-developer is sticking to what they know in a familiar domain, GitHub, and is seeking to deepen their
  knowledge and capacity in this platform. This they seek to showcase this in this project.

**`Common Files`**: These are files like Licence, CodeOwners, Authors.md, Acknowledgements.md, c etc.
