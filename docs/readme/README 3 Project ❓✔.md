### 3.4. [Readme]()

> PROJECT: Style | Approach | Key Deliverable

-   [x] Criteria: README
-   [ ] Completed? 🛫

-   In English.
-   Defined upfront, at start of the project cycle, a planning and delivery tool, not as an afterthought.
-   Highly descriptive.
-   Heading Hierarchy.
-   Sequenced heading numbering.
-   Headings linked and anchored.
-   Highly detailed.
-   Not Conventional, counter traditional and beyond the CI recommendation.
-   Professional-grade project management and solution documentation.
-   In the style of Readme Driven Development, this was written first before any code was committed.

### 3.5 [Project Template](#project-template)

> PROJECT: Pre-configured | Pre-developed | Custom-Developed

-   [SOURCE: GitHub - P4 Template: github.com/iPoetDev/P4Template](https://github.com/iPoetDev/P4Template)

-   Pre-configured by author-developer.
-   Pre-defined by author-developer.
-   It's own project effort to keep repository management #DRY, repeatable, centralised managed.
-   Pre-setup of Agile Project Management workflows:
    -   GitHub is a blank slate with no pre-configuration.
    -   GitHub is highly flexible by being blank slate.
-   Has development history (`commits`) for blocks of non-source code for configuration (`.yaml`) and
    documentation (`.md`).
    -   _Excludes_: source code/solution-level code for any subsequent project.
    -   _Setting_: enabled the **Template repository**option.
        -   Template repositories let users generate new repositories with the same directory structure and files
        -   [Learn more about template repositories](https://docs.github.com/articles/creating-a-repository-from-a-template/).
-   Focus is on:
    -   _Workflows_: GitHub Features: GitHub Issues Templates, GitHub Projects, GitHub Milestones
    -   _Configuration_: YAML
    -   _Documentation_: Markdown
-   Create **`DRY` Repositories**:
    -   _New_: Generated new repositories.
    -   _Style_: Boilerplate
    -   _Is Not_: cookiecutter or copier defined.

#### 3.5.1 [GitHub to Agile Workflows](#github-agile-issues)

> PROJECT: Methodology | Workflows | Template | Deliverable | Agile Issues | Agile Milestones

-   Uses [GitHub Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) to track ideas,
    feedback, tasks (workflows), or bugs for work on GitHub.
-   Agile adaption in GitHub requires defining and designing the
    following `workflows` | `procedures` | `plans` | `reports` by defining `Issue Templates`
    -   Agile Artefacts (see 3.3 above, and as follows)
-   **<ins>Requirements | Decisions</ins>**: as GitHub Issues -> Requirements | Specifications | Decisions
    -   ADR Full
    -   ADR Y Stat
-   **<ins>AGILE Items</ins>**: as GitHub Issues -> Workflows | Tickets | Work Items
