### 4.3. Web App Capabilities

> SOLUTION:

-   [ ] Criteria:
-   [ ] Completed? ðŸ›«

This app will serve users with the following:

-   Ability, **_must have_**, to _`use|integrate`_ GitHub as a _`primary|secondary`_ _`social login`_ to
    _`access|connect`_ and _`authenticate`_ to the main web _`app|service`_. #Authentication #Access #Authorisation
    #Onboarding
-   Ability, **_must have_**, to _`interact`_ with GitHub's API to access the public application and data interfaces of
    the GitHub platform, so to _`manipulate`_ and _`aggregate`_ one's own _`account|repository`_ data. #API #RestFul
-   Ability, **_should have_**, to _`analyse`_ all repositories, _`public and|or private`_ and _`categorise`_ them, in
    bulk: #Repositories #DataAnalysis
    -   The scope and frequency of languages uses. GitHub has this feature per repository.
    -   The scope and frequency of file types uses (?). Subject to GitHub API definitions and terms of service.
    -   The presence/absence of labels, number and completeness.
-   Ability, **_should have_**, to _`report`_, using a _`client|server`_ rendered visual summarisation and collation
    approach, on the state of all repositories, and to _`provide`_ a an **_`"at a glance"`_** snapshot on the state of the
    account's repositories.
-   Ability, **_could have_**, to perform bulk actions on specific GitHub features like:
    -   **_Labels_** #FeatureCRUD
    -   **_`Config.yml`_** #FileIO #API-I/O
    -   **_Common Files_**, or Common Project files (see below). #FileI/O #API-I/O
-   Ability, **could have**, to `store` a central file _`type|store`_, i.e. a pre-defined template, for a specific purpose
    and then `'Copy'` and `'Apply'` across those repository that do not have them. #FileIO #API-I/O
    **- Will not** have the ability to edit or change these files inside the web app.
    -   This is out of scope as IDEs and the basic GitHub editing functionalities serve this role.
        **- Will not** have the ability to manipulate GitHub Account Settings or have the permission granted to them.
        #NotInScope
-   Ability, **should have**, to _`remove`_ a GitHub _`social login`_ as a _`primary|secondary`_ source of _`access`_,
    _`authorisation`_ and or _`authentication`_, without affecting the primary login model and access control. #GitHub
    #Integration #OffBoarding

    -   On the other hand, applying the same conventions, and standards consistently and uniformly across all the
        repositories.
-   These user and usability frustration are a by-product of the user's personal experiences and user journey when using
    GitHub.com.
