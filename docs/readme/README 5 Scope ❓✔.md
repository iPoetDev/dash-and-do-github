### 5.4 [Browsers Compatibility](#compatibilities)

> SOLUTION: Browser Install | Compatibility | Feature | Components | Target Audiences

- The application design for the web is further constrained by it's available global or local audience and their
  install-base of a browser.
- Browser compatibility is a essential aspect of a web application as the browser is the fundamental web application
  end-point
- Developer tools, like Autofixer (which tailwind recommends for aplpying browser vendor pre-fixes) aid in ensuring code
  compatibility and quality with Browsers
- So using these two services will aid the developer experience and utilmately the user experience
